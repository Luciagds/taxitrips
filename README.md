# Analizing NYC Taxi Trips

Every Thanksgiving, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers leave the city to visit their relatives, while many others decide to stay. The New York City Council is interested in knowing how busy streets are and where people travel inside the city during this important holiday. So, the aim of this work is to analyse the New York City network of taxi trips to discover further insights regarding how people move within the city, which are the busiest hours, or what factors have the greatest influence on tips. The dataset to be used can be found here.

To do so, different tasks will be carried out: (1) **data exploration and cleaning** to preprocess the data and prepare it for the analysis, (2) **data summary** to find out interesting features, insigths and patterns within the data, and (3) **model building** to better understand what is the typical tip clients leave to cab drivers depending on the trip and what factors influence this amount the most.
